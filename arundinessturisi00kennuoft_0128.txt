1 1 2 POEMA TA VA'RJA.

While Desolation marks her furious course,
And thrones, subverted, bow beneath her force.

Behold! she pours her Monarch’s guiltless blood,
And quaffs, with savage joy, the crimson flood 3
Then, proud the deadly trophies to display

Of her foul crime, resistless bursts away,

Unaw'd by justice, unappall’d by sear,

And runs with giant strength her mad career.

Where'er her banners float in barbarous pride,
VVhere’er her conquest rolls its sanguine tide,
There, the fair fabric of establish⁷d law,
There social order, and religious avve,

Sink in the general wreck; indignant there
Honour and Virtue fly the tainted air ,·

Fly the mild duties of domestic life

That cheer the parent, that endear the wife,
The lingering pangs of kindred grief assuage,
Or sooth the sorrows of declining age.

Nor yet can Hope presage the auspicious hour,
When Peace shall check the rage of lawless Power;
Nor yet the insatiate thirst of blood is o’er,
Nor yet has Rapine ravaged every shore.
Exhaustless Passion feeds the augmented flame,
And wild Ambition mocks the voice of Shame:
Revenge, with haggard look and scowling eyes,
Surveys with horrid joy the expected prize;
Prowls round each remnant of monarchic sway‚
And dooms to certain death his fancied prey.
