POEMA TA VARJA. ι 1 3

For midst the ruins of each falling state,

ONE Fixvomz'n Nmox braves the general stite,
One favour'd Nadon, whose impartial laws

Of sober Freedom vindicate the cause;

Her simple manners, midst surrounding crimes,
Proclaim the genuine worth of ancient times:
True to herself, unconquerably bold,

The Rights her valour gain'd she dares uphold;
Still with pure saith her promise dares sulfil,
Still bows submission to the Almighty Will.

Just Heav'n! how Envy kindles at the sight!
How mad Ambition pians the desperate fight!
With what new fury Vengeance hastes to pour
Her tribes of rapine from yon crowded shore!
Just Heav’n! how fair a victim at the shrine
Of injured Freedom shall her life resign, ⁶
If e'er, propitious to the vows of hate,
Unsteady Conquest stamp our mournful fate;
If e’er proud Franee usurp our ancient reign,
And ride triumphant o'er the insulted main!

Far hence the unmanly thought—The voice of Fame,
Wafts o'er the applauding deep her Duncan's name.
What though the Conqueror of the Italian plains
Deem nothing gain’d, while this fair Isle remains,
Though his young breast with rash presumption glow,
He braves the vengeance of no vulgar foe:
Conqueror no more, full soon his laurel'd pride
Shall perish-whelm'd in Ocean’s angry tide;
