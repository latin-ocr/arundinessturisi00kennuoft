TENNYSON'S EXHIBITION ODE, 1862,

Uplift a thousand voices full and sweet,

In this wide hall with earth's inventions stored‚
And haise th’ invisible universal Lord,

Wh0¹1ets once more in peace the nations meet,
XVhere Science, Art, and Labour have outpour'd
Their myriad horns of plenty at our feet.

O silent Father of our Kings to be
Mourn'd in the golden hour of jubilee,
For this, for all, we weep our thanks to Thee!

The world compelling plan was thine,
And, lo! the long laborious miles
Of Palaee, lo! the giant aisles‚
Rich in model and design;
Harvest-tool and husbandry,

Loom and wheel and engin'ry
Secrets of the sullen mine,

Stcel and gold, and corn and wine,
Fabric rough, or Fairy fine,

Sunny tokens of the Line,

Polar marvels, and a feast

Of wonder, out of West and East,
And sbapes and hues of art Divine!
