56 POEMATA SACRA.

The following lines, by way of epitaph, were written soon after the
Bishop’s death, and inserted in Webb's Collection of Epstaphs,

vol. i. p. 97.

Beneath this marble Butler lies entomb⁷d;

Who, with a soul inflamed by love divine,

His life in presence of his God consumed,

Like the bright lamps before the holy shrine.
His aspect pleasing, mind with learning fraught 3
His eloquence was like a chain of gold,

That the wild passions of mankind controll'd.
Merit, wherever to be found, he sought:

Desire of transient siches he had none,

These he with bounteous hand did well dispense,
Bent to fulfil the ends of vaideuce,

His heart still fix'd on an immortal crown.

His heart a mirror was of purest kind,

Where the bright image of his Maker shined;
Refieeting faithful to the throne above

The irradiant glories of the Mystic Dove. .
