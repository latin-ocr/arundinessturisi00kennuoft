POEMA TA VAA’JA. 1 15

All of beauty‚ all of use,

That one fair planet can produce,
Brought from under every star,

Blown from over every main,

And mix’d‚ as life is mixt with pain,
The works of peace with works of war.
And is the goal so far away?

Far, how far, no man can say:

Let us have our dream to-day.

O ye, the wise who think, the wise who reign,
From growing commerce loose her latest chain,
And let the fair white-wing'd peacemaker fly
To happy heavens under all the sky,
And mix the seasons and the golden hours,
Till each man finds his own in all men’s good,
And all men work in noble brotherhood,
Breaking their mailed fleets and armed towers,
And ruling by obeying nature’s powers,
And gathering all the fruits of peace, and crown'd
with all her flowers.

LATINE REDDITUM.

Tollite dulcisonos, pleno ore accendite cantus,

Hic ubi vasta Domus, quodcunque habet optima tellus,
Continet ; occultumque Deum laudate supremum!

Ille etenim unanimas hodie conjungier omnes

Dat gentes, et pace frui5 dum munera circum

Mille Labor fundit, ditatque Ars alma colentes!
