104 POEMATA VARJA.

XXIV.

WHEN THE ASSAULT WAS INTENDED TO
THE CITY.

Captain‚ or Colonel, or Knight in arms,

Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize,

If deed of honour did thee ever please,

Guard them, and him within protect from harms.
He can requite thee, for he knows the charms
That eall fame on such gentle acts as these,
And he can spread thy name o’er lands and seas,
Whatever clime the sun’s bright circle warms.
Lift not thy spear against the Muses' bower!
The great Emathian conqueror bad spare

The house of Pindarus when temple and tower
Went to the ground, and the repeated air

Of sad Electra’s poet had the power

To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare.
