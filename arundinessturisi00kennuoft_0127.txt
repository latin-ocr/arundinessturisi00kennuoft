POEMA TA VARJA. 1 1 1

Di meliora piis atque exitium hostibus illud!

Dum loquimur, plausu praepes trans aequora vecta
Nuntia Fama volat Duncani facta reportans.

Quid, si qui Ausonia descendit victor ab ora,

Nil se profecisse putet, dum invicta resistat

Insula nostra mari? Quid, si ambitione nefanda

Flagret adhuc juvenis? Quemnam nunc provocat hos-
tem?

Hactenus invictus tandem succumbere discat
Victori! Nobis etenim Ponti deus adstat,
Pro carisque suis propugnat, ut ante, Britannis.

Wellesley.)

Parent of countless crimes, in headlong rage,

War with herself see frantie Gallia wage,

Till worn and wasted by intestine strife,

She falls—her languid pulse searce quick with life.
But soon she feels through every trembling vein,
New strength collected from convulsive pain:
Onward she moves, and sounds the dire alann,

And bids insulted nations haste to arm ;

Spreads wide the waste of War, and hurls the brand
Of Civil Diseord o’er each troubled land,
